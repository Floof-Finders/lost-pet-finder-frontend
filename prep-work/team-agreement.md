Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
